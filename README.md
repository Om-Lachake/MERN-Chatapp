- Secure logout using Redis for session invalidation.
- Retrieve user profiles and list all other users.

### 2. **Project Management**
- Create, retrieve, and manage projects.
- Add users to projects with proper validation.
- Update and fetch project-specific file structures.

### 3. **AI Integration**
- Seamless integration with Google Generative AI for prompt-based content generation.
- Supports configurable AI models with tailored system instructions for optimal performance.

## Environment Variables

Configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

  **`BACKEND`**

- **`PORT`**: The port number on which the application server will run (e.g., `3000`).

- **`MONGODB_URI`**: The connection string for your MongoDB database. It typically includes the database host, port, and credentials, e.g., `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/<dbname>`.

- **`JWT_SECRET`**: A secret key used to sign and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication. Ensure this is a strong, unique string.

- **`REDIS_HOST`**: The hostname or IP address of the Redis server used for session and cache management.

- **`REDIS_PORT`**: The port on which the Redis server is running (default is `6379`).

- **`REDIS_PASSWORD`**: The password required to authenticate with the Redis server (if authentication is enabled).

- **`GOOGLE_AI_KEY`**: The API key for accessing Google Generative AI services, used to authenticate API requests.


  **`FRONTEND`**

- **`VITE_API_URL`**: The base URL for the frontend application to communicate with the backend API during development or production.
